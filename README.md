# Fitness APP

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a fitness app where users can track the progress of their runs as well as compare the data with their friends.

## Timeline

1. Create an database and an API to access the database
2. Create an Android App the displayes and keeps track of the users progress
3. Connect the app with the API

## Technologies

- Python and Flask for the API
- MongoDB for the database
- Android Studio and Java for the APP
- Google Maps API to display the route of the user

## API

The API allows access the database that contains information about users.

### Usage

Please see the manual testing plan to see what is required from your machine. It also contains several examples on how to access the API if there is any confusion. For this project I heavily utilized postman for testing the API.

### Warnings

Please make sure to run the API before running the tests or using postman to manually test the API.

## APP

### Device Support

The app was tested on Android 10 using the Google Pixel 3a.

### Warnings

GPS must be enabled on the device to function correctly.
